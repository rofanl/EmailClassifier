<http://betterwayworkshops.com/u/0jaa.php>     I do believe we're all connected. I do believe in positive energy. I do believe in the power of prayer. I do believe in putting good out into the world. And I believe in taking care of each other.    If we're growing; we're always going to be out of our comfort zone.    Learning is a gift. Even when pain is your teacher.    No matter what the situation; remind yourself I have a choice.      Best Regards
